## Seedbox A/B Testing: Different Cancellation Methods for Subscription Service

In this analysis, we are going to examine the effect of forcing members of a subscription service to cancel by phone call and whether or not this has an impact on the probability of cancellations. Test subjects were split into two groups: the control group, who could cancel their subscriptions using a simple web form (control group = 0) and the test group, who could only cancel their subscriptions by calling in (test group = 1). 



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
